  <h1>ABOUT ME!</h1>
  <h2>Comfort Museo</h2>
  <img src="images/comfort.jpg" width="200" height="300">
  <p>Comfort Museo is the Founder and CEO of Qigg, an e-commerce platform for B2B Services. Comfort is passionate about
    Entrepreneurship, having worked actively with SMEs on a business development role for 2+ years. Up untill June 30th,
    Comfort was part of a 6-month Incubation Program by Techbridge Invest Africa. Comfort has gained extensive knowledge
    on how to grow a Start-up from a business perspective, and she would like to now improve her Tech capabilities in
    order to be a well-rounded leader. For this reason Comfort has joined Moringa School, one of the best programming
    bootcamps in Kenya, and Africa at large. She hopes that this dive into a some-what challenging experience will be a
    value addition as she builds one of the best tech company of our time.</p>
  <p>In her free time, Comfort loves to do either one of the following things:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Go bike riding</li>
    <li>Read <strong>The Misadventures of Awkward Black girl</strong> by <em>Issa Rae</em></li>
    <li>Watch funny videos on YouTube</li>
    <li>And more fun, outdoorsy things!</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I have so far, since joining Moringa school, built using HTML <a href="https://c-museo.github.io/My-first-webpage/"target ="this portfolio"</a> my first website</p>
